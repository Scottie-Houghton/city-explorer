## Overview
*Allow users to enter a city they want to explore and get info about it.

## Getting Started
* Install React and its Bootstrap and Axios libraries

<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
* Using HTML, CSS and Javascript and React libraries, including Bootstrap and Axios.

<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
