**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
* Allow users to enter a city they want to explore and get info about it, including latitude, longitude, an image of a map of the city and a 3-day forecast.

<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started
* Install React and its Bootstrap and Axios libraries. You will also need Express JS and dotenv.

<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
* Using HTML, CSS and Javascript and React libraries, including Bootstrap and Axios.

<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
* 06-20-2022 9:30pm - Application has a GET route to LocationIQ. It has a form you can input a city into. The form retrieves data using LocationIQ's API and renders the city name, latitude, longitude and displays an image of a map of the city.
